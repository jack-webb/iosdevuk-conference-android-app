# iOSDevUK Conference App


### Overview

This app is part of my assessment for the third-year Android module at Aberystwyth University. It allows users to view a schedule for iOSDevUK, an iOS developer conference held at the university each year. Users can also favourite events, and view information about
speakers and campus event locations.

It is almost complete, with a small number of missing features and a small bit of polish missing. The biggest missing features are the lack of notifications for favourited sessions, and no dark theme. I think there are also a few unused dependencies.

This repo has been uploaded as-is, from when I submitted the project. I haven't made any changes from the submission, nor do I plan to.
